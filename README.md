# octo2influx - Fork
This is my fork of [yo8192's octo2influx](https://github.com/yo8192/octo2influx) project.

**Breaking changes**
> A bug Grafana version `11.1` breaks the Flux queries used for tariff pricing. 
> - I recommend using `grafana/grafana:11.0.1` until the following issue is fixed.
> - https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/89948

My reasons for forking the project are:
- I use Unraid as my Docker environment, which has its own peculiarities and does not run docker-compose natively.
- I like versioning images and making them available for distribution.
- It gives me another reason to play with GitHub actions.

The octo2influx tool enables users to download their Octopus Energy usage, including import and export data.
The latter is for solar equipped properties that export energy back to the grid.

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) v2 database and display in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

## About
octo2influx retrieves energy usage data and the tariffs using the [Octopus API](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/).

The tool calculates the cost based on the tariff. You can switch between tariffs to compare costs.
>Additional tariffs need to be configured to compare prices.

In my case, I have only configured the current active tariff and will add more as needed or when I change to a new one.

For example, switching to the "Agile" tariff during the same time period on the dashboard above will provide us with 
a different cost readout.

## Installation and Running
This fork focuses on running the application with Docker.
- docker-compose
- Docker run
- Unraid Docker template

```shell
docker run -d --name='octo2influx' -e 'FREQ'='1h' -v '/mnt/user/appdata/octo2influx':'/etc/octo2influx/':'rw' --restart=unless-stopped 'ghcr.io/echoblag/octo2influx:latest'
```

The image has been extended in a few small areas to make it easier to update and setting file permissions.

> The application can be run as a standalone Python process using `python3 ./octo2influx.py`

### Data Availability
Octopus typically makes your usage data available the next day.
> If you have recently had smart meters installed, it can take a few days for consumption data to start coming in.

## Configuration
First, create your own `config.yaml` file using the [example](src/config.example.yaml) as a starting point.
how to get the information you need.

The priority of configuration options from highest to lowest is:
1. Environment variables
2. Command line flags
3. Config file

> The help section provides all the CLI flags and their equivalent environment variables. 

> The settings can be declared in the config file `config.yaml` located in `/etc/octo2influx`.

The application has a flexible command line parameters with a detailed help section:
```
python3 ./octo2influx.py --help
usage: octo2influx [-h] [--from_max_days_ago FROM_MAX_DAYS_AGO] [--from_days_ago FROM_DAYS_AGO] [--to_days_ago TO_DAYS_AGO] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] [--timezone TIMEZONE]

## Acknowledgements
This is a fork of the https://github.com/yo8192/octo2influx project that integrates GitHub Actions to build images as well as 
dependency management.

### Pre-fork
The [yo8192's octo2influx](https://github.com/yo8192/octo2influx) project is originally based on https://github.com/stevenewey/octograph/.

The motivation for the rewrite came following a solar installation, the project was largely rewritten to use 
InfluxDB v2 and the Influx query language, factoring in electricity export and an updated Grafana dashboard.
